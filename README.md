Clarifications and notes brought to our attention:
- the kraken db build command in the manuscript is for the bacterial database; the command for the standard db is available through the kraken manual: kraken-build --standard --db $DBNAME (our database was constructed in July 2015)
- it should read Segata, et al. (2012) not (2013) in Table S2
- the abundances in the _abund.txt files within truth_set_relative_abundances.zip were provided by Nicola Segata for the LC and HC datasets here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metaphlan-users/UECjtMsMZEY
- Table S3 includes an abundance filter of 0.01
